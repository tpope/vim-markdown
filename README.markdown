# Vim Markdown runtime files

This is the development version of Vim's included syntax highlighting and
filetype plugins for Markdown. Generally you don't need to install these if
you are running a recent version of Vim.

## Configuration

### Fenced code block highlighting

To enable fenced code block syntax highlighting in your markdown
documents, add the following to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:markdown_fenced_languages = ['html', 'python', 'bash=sh']

**Note**: The fenced language names must be valid names of syntax files in vim's
`syntax` folder. For example: `syntax/ruby.vim`.

### Syntax concealment

To disable markdown syntax concealing, add the following to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:markdown_syntax_conceal = 0

### Highlighting synchronization

Syntax highlighting is synchronized in 50 lines. This may cause collapsed
highlighting on large fenced code blocks.
In that case, set `g:markdown_minlines` to a larger value in your `.vimrc`:

    let g:markdown_minlines = 100

**Note**: Setting `g:markdown_minlines` to a value that is too large value may
cause poor highlighting performance.

### Folding

To enable folding, add the following to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:markdown_folding = 1
